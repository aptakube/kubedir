Aptakube is Kubernetes GUI to help you manage your Kubernetes cluster, view logs, create and edit resources, and more — all in a user-friendly and intuitive UI. The app runs on your desktop and does not require any server or additional components to operate. It's like a graphical version of `kubectl` on steroids.

It's designed to be a simple and straightforward tool to get things done without getting in your way. One of its unique features is the ability to connect to multiple clusters at the same time, which gives you the feeling of a single cluster with a global view of all resources spread across multiple clusters.
